## 📚 Inspiration

Learning complex topics often feels like navigating a maze: disconnected concepts, no clear path forward, and no feedback on what’s mastered. Syntra was inspired by the need for a tool that not only aggregates the world’s learning resources but actively helps users see and build their understanding—concept by concept, connection by connection.

## 🚀 What it does

- **Interactive Knowledge Graph** – Visualize your knowledge as a dynamic, AI-structured map.  
- **Automatic Connections** – Gemini AI links new topics to related nodes and finds subtopics within each concept.  
- **Resource Aggregation** – Instantly pulls Wikipedia summaries, YouTube tutorials, and arXiv papers as you explore.  
- **Mastery Tracking** – Update your understanding with a single click—your progress is visualized and analyzed.  
- **AI Recommendations** – Snowflake logs every interaction; Mistral and Cortex AI analyze your patterns, recommending what to learn next and where to bridge knowledge gaps.  
- **Subtopic Generation & Bridge Topics** – Intra-Explore unveils granular subtopics, and AI builds bridges between seemingly distant areas—no more blind spots in your learning.

## 🛠️ How we built it

**Frontend**

- React + Vite for a fast, interactive UI  
- D3 and XYFlow for force-directed graph visualization  

**Backend**

- Node.js + Express / TypeScript APIs for graph/knowledge management and resource aggregation  

**AI & Data Layer**

- Gemini AI for semantic node linking, bridge topics, and subtopic generation  
- Python microservice (FastAPI/Flask) for analytics, mastery calculation, and integration with Snowflake  
- **Snowflake** as the data warehouse, logging user activity and learning paths at scale  
- **Mistral & Cortex AI** for mastery scoring, pattern recognition, and real-time topic recommendations  

**APIs**

- Real-time scraping/fetching from Wikipedia, YouTube Data API, arXiv  
- Future plans: Khan Academy and news integrations  

**DevOps**

- Modular microservice structure  
- Code-splitting and RESTful interfaces  
- Local/remote mode support  

---

## 🧱 Challenges we ran into

- **AI Integration** – Prompt engineering for Gemini to give robust, controlled chains/subtopics and minimize hallucinations.  
- **Analytics Pipelining** – Designing interaction log/mastery calculation flows that work smoothly across REST (Node) and analytics (Python/Snowflake).  
- **Graph Visualization** – Efficiently rendering large, growing graphs with force-directed layouts and real-time edge/node styling.  
- **Domain Scaling** – Creating subject-agnostic routines for node-linking, subtopic extraction, and mastery analytics.

## ✨ Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Reliable multi-level mastery tracking, supporting both manual and data-driven updates.  
- Seamless AI-driven graph linking and subtopic/bridge node generation.  
- Real-time integration of learning resources—articles, videos, papers—without page reloads or blocking.  
- Robust logging and analysis pipeline for personalized mastery and recommendation.

---

## 🧠 What we learned

- The value of decoupling slow content (arXiv) from instant knowledge (Wikipedia/YouTube/IQ).  
- How to tune AI prompts for "just right" knowledge chaining, avoiding overly generic or overconnected topics.  
- That mastery is best represented not as a static value but as a dynamic function of actual user behaviors.  
- How enterprise-grade analytics (Snowflake) can power personalized learning at any scale.

## ⏭️ What's next for Syntra

- **Integrations** – Add Khan Academy, news article APIs, and other educational resources.  
- **Collaborative Analytics** – Use Cortex to analyze aggregate user paths and success, feeding those insights back into recommendations for all users.  
- **Deeper Semantic Search** – Vertex AI / embedding-based search for resources and graph linking.  
- **Mobile App & Offline Support** – For universal, accessible, and context-aware learning.  
- **Public API and Plugins** – Help third parties extend Syntra’s brain into their platforms.
